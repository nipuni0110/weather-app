The HTML file creates a weather app using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users enter a city name to get current weather details including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon. It's user-friendly, responsive, and updates dynamically based on the user's input.
The CSS stylesheet defines the styling for a weather app interface, featuring a gradient card layout with search input, button, weather details, and icons, designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly.
